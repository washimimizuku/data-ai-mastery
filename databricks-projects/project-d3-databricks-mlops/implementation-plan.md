# Implementation Plan: MLOps with MLflow & Feature Store

## Timeline: 3-4 Days

## Day 1: Feature Store (8 hours)
- [ ] Set up Databricks workspace
- [ ] Create sample datasets
- [ ] Implement feature engineering
- [ ] Create Feature Store tables
- [ ] Test feature serving (online/offline)

## Day 2: ML Training (8 hours)
- [ ] Implement training pipeline with MLflow
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning with Hyperopt
- [ ] Model registry setup
- [ ] Model versioning and staging
- [ ] Unity Catalog integration

## Day 3: Deployment (8 hours)
- [ ] Create model serving endpoints
- [ ] Implement batch inference
- [ ] Set up A/B testing
- [ ] Configure monitoring and drift detection
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow

## Day 4: Automation & Documentation (6-8 hours)
- [ ] Build automated ML pipeline (Jobs)
- [ ] CI/CD integration
- [ ] Architecture diagrams
- [ ] "ML Platform Comparison: Databricks vs. SageMaker"
- [ ] Demo video and blog post
