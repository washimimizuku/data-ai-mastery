# Implementation Plan: Snowpark ML & Feature Engineering Platform

## Timeline: 3-4 Days

## Day 1: Feature Engineering (8 hours)
- [ ] Set up Snowpark environment and session
- [ ] Load sample dataset (100M+ rows)
- [ ] Implement aggregation features
- [ ] Implement window function features
- [ ] Create feature store tables
- [ ] Test performance at scale

## Day 2: ML Training (8 hours)
- [ ] Implement Snowpark ML training pipeline
- [ ] Create UDFs for custom transformations
- [ ] Build stored procedures for workflows
- [ ] Model versioning and registry
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Batch scoring implementation

## Day 3: Hybrid Architecture (8 hours)
- [ ] SageMaker integration setup
- [ ] External function configuration
- [ ] Performance comparison (Snowpark vs. Spark vs. SageMaker)
- [ ] Cost analysis
- [ ] Optimization tuning

## Day 4: Documentation (6-8 hours)
- [ ] Architecture diagrams
