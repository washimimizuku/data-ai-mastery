## Week 1 Checklist

By end of week 1, you should have:

- [ ] Development environment set up
- [ ] GitHub account created
- [ ] Chosen your learning path
- [ ] Completed 6 days of your first bootcamp
- [ ] Created a learning journal (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Joined at least one community (Reddit, Discord)

---

## Your First Project (Week 2-3)

After completing 10-14 days of your bootcamp, build your first quick win project:

### Recommended First Projects

**If doing SQL bootcamp**:
- Wait until Day 15, then build a simple data analysis project

**If doing 100 Days bootcamp**:
- After Day 7: [Project H - Data Format Benchmark](https://github.com/washimimizuku/core-data-engineering-projects/tree/main/project-h-format-benchmark)
- Compare CSV, JSON, Parquet performance
- 1-2 days (8-16 hours)

---

## Daily Routine

### Sustainable Learning Schedule

**Weekdays** (1.5-2 hours):
- 1 hour: Bootcamp lesson
- 30 minutes: Hands-on exercises
- 15 minutes: Notes and reflection

**Weekends** (2-3 hours):
- 1 hour: Bootcamp lesson
- 1 hour: Extra practice or project work
- 30 minutes: Review week's learning

### Tips for Success

1. **Same time every day** - Build a habit
2. **Eliminate distractions** - Phone away, focus mode
3. **Take notes** - Write down key concepts
4. **Code along** - Don't just read, type the code
5. **Ask questions** - Use communities when stuck

---

## Common First Week Issues

### "I'm stuck on Day X"

**Solutions**:
- Re-read the instructions carefully
- Search the error message online
- Skip and come back tomorrow
- Ask in community forums
- Check the bootcamp's issues/discussions

### "This is taking longer than 1 hour"

**That's normal!** Estimates are for experienced learners. Taking 1.5-2 hours per day is fine, especially at the start.

### "I don't understand a concept"

**Try this**:
1. Re-read the explanation
2. Search for the concept on YouTube
3. Try the exercises anyway (learning by doing)
4. Ask in communities
5. Move forward, it may click later

### "I missed a day"

**No problem!** Just continue where you left off. Consistency matters more than perfection.

## Motivation

### Remember Why You Started

Write down your goals:
- Why are you learning data engineering?
- What job do you want?
- What projects excite you?
- Where do you want to be in 12 months?

Keep this visible. Read it when motivation dips.

### You've Got This!

Thousands have completed this journey. You can too. The key is:
- **Start today** (not tomorrow)
- **Stay consistent** (even 30 minutes counts)
- **Build projects** (not just consume content)
- **Share progress** (accountability helps)
- **Be patient** (6-12 months is realistic)
