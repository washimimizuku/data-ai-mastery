# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### Do I need to complete all bootcamps?

No. Phase 1 (Core Languages) is entirely optional. If you already know Python, SQL, or Rust, skip those bootcamps. The only required bootcamps are:
- 100 Days of Data and AI (Phase 2)
- 60 Days of Advanced Data and AI (Phase 4)

### Can I skip Phase 1 entirely?

Yes! If you already have basic programming knowledge (Python, SQL), jump straight to Phase 2 (100 Days bootcamp).

### Which language bootcamp should I start with?

If doing Phase 1, prioritize in this order:
1. **SQL** - Most important for data work
2. **Python** - Primary language for data engineering
3. **Rust** - Optional, for performance optimization

You can do them in parallel if you have time.

### How much time do I really need per day?

- **Minimum path**: 3 hours/day for 6 months
- **Standard path**: 1.5-2 hours/day for 9 months
- **Comprehensive path**: 2 hours/day for 12 months

Consistency matters more than intensity. 1 hour daily beats 7 hours on Sunday.

## Projects

### Do I need to build all 18 quick win projects?

No. Build 4-6 projects (2-3 from data engineering, 2-3 from AI). This takes 1-2 weeks.

### How many comprehensive projects should I build?

Build 3-5 comprehensive projects based on your interests. Each takes 2-3 months. This is enough for a strong portfolio.

### Can I build projects in a different order?

Yes, but recommended order:
1. Start with quick win projects (after 100 Days)
2. Build comprehensive projects (after 60 Days Advanced)
3. Add platform projects if targeting specific platforms

### What if I don't have time for 2-3 months per project?

You can build simplified versions in less time, but comprehensive projects are designed to be portfolio-quality and production-ready. Quality over quantity.

---

## Learning Path

### Can I do bootcamps and projects in parallel?

Yes! Recommended approach:
- Do quick win projects while in 100 Days bootcamp (after Day 50)
- Start comprehensive projects while in 60 Days Advanced bootcamp

### What if I already know some topics?

Skip those sections or skim them quickly. The bootcamps are modular - you can jump around.

### Is the order strict?

Mostly yes for bootcamps:
1. Phase 1 (optional) → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4

Projects can be more flexible, but build quick wins before comprehensive projects.

### Can I take breaks?

Absolutely. Life happens. Just try to maintain some consistency to retain what you've learned.

## Platform-Specific

### Should I learn Snowflake or Databricks?

Depends on your goals:
- **Snowflake**: Data warehousing, analytics-heavy roles
- **Databricks**: ML/AI-heavy roles, lakehouse architecture
- **Both**: Maximum flexibility (adds 2-3 months)
- **Neither**: Focus on core skills first, add platforms later

### Are platform bootcamps required?

No, they're optional (Phase 6). Only do them if:
- Targeting specific platform roles
- Want platform certifications
- Have extra time after core learning

### Can I learn both platforms?

Yes, but it adds 2-3 months. Better to master one platform first, then add the second if needed.

---

## Job Readiness

### When am I ready to apply for jobs?

After completing:
- 100 Days + 60 Days bootcamps
- 3-4 comprehensive projects
- Portfolio on GitHub

This gives you 90-95% job readiness for mid to senior-level roles.

### What's the missing 5-10%?

Things learned on the job:
- Company-specific tools
- Domain knowledge
- Team collaboration
- Production troubleshooting

This is normal and expected for any new role.

### Do I need certifications?

Not required for this learning path. Focus on skills and projects first. Certifications can come later based on career goals.

### What job titles can I target?

After completing the path:
- Data Engineer (Mid to Senior)
- ML Engineer
- AI Engineer
- MLOps Engineer
- Analytics Engineer

## Technical Questions

### What if I get stuck on a bootcamp day?

- Review the documentation
- Search for the error online
- Ask in community forums (Reddit, Discord)
- Skip and come back later
- Open an issue on the bootcamp repository

### Do I need expensive hardware?

No. Most bootcamps and projects work on:
- Laptop with 8GB+ RAM
- Cloud free tiers (AWS, GCP)
- Local tools (DuckDB, Ollama)

Some ML projects may benefit from GPU, but cloud options exist.

### What if I don't have AWS/cloud experience?

The 100 Days bootcamp includes AWS basics. You'll learn as you go. Free tier is sufficient for learning.

### Can I use Windows/Mac/Linux?

Yes, all three work. Instructions are generally OS-agnostic. Some tools may have OS-specific setup.

---

## Community

### Where can I ask questions?

- Open issues on specific bootcamp repositories
- Join Reddit: r/dataengineering, r/MachineLearning
- Discord communities for specific tools
- LinkedIn groups

### Can I share my progress?

Yes! Sharing helps you and others:
- Blog posts about your learning
- GitHub repositories with your projects
- LinkedIn updates
- Twitter/X threads

### How can I contribute?

See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines. Contributions welcome:
- Fix typos or errors
- Improve documentation
- Share your experience
- Suggest improvements

---

## Cost

### Is this free?

The bootcamps and learning path are free. Costs may include:
- Cloud services (AWS free tier available)
- Optional paid courses or books
- Platform certifications (if pursuing)

### How much will cloud services cost?

Minimal if using free tiers:
- AWS: $0-50/month for learning
- Most projects designed for free tier
- Can delete resources after learning

### Do I need paid tools?

No. All bootcamps use free and open-source tools:
- Python, SQL, Rust (free)
- DuckDB, PostgreSQL (free)
- VS Code (free)
- Docker (free)
- Most ML frameworks (free)

## Success

### What if I don't finish in the estimated time?

That's okay! The timelines are estimates. Go at your own pace. Taking 18 months instead of 12 is fine.

### What if I fail a project?

Failure is learning. Try again, simplify the scope, or ask for help. Every project teaches something.

### How do I stay motivated?

- Set small, achievable goals
- Share your progress publicly
- Join learning communities
- Build projects you're excited about
- Remember why you started

### What's the success rate?

Success depends on consistency and effort. Those who:
- Study regularly (even 1 hour/day)
- Build projects (not just consume content)
- Share and get feedback
- Stay consistent for 6-12 months

...have very high success rates.
