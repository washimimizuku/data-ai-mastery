# Implementation Plan: LLM Fine-Tuning & Inference Optimization

## Timeline: 2-3 weeks

## Week 1: Dataset & Training
- [ ] Choose base model (Llama 3, Mistral)
- [ ] Prepare training dataset
- [ ] Format data for instruction tuning
- [ ] Set up training environment
- [ ] Implement LoRA fine-tuning
- [ ] Train model
- [ ] Track experiments with MLflow

## Week 2: Optimization & Serving
- [ ] Evaluate fine-tuned model
- [ ] Implement quantization
- [ ] Set up vLLM
- [ ] Build FastAPI service
- [ ] Add streaming responses
- [ ] Benchmark performance

## Week 3: Deployment & Documentation
- [ ] Deploy to Modal/RunPod
- [ ] Run cost analysis
- [ ] Compare with base model
- [ ] Create evaluation report
- [ ] Write documentation
- [ ] Record demo

## Deliverables
- [ ] Fine-tuned model
- [ ] Training notebooks
- [ ] FastAPI inference service
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Cost analysis
- [ ] Deployment guide
